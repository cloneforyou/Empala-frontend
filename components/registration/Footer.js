      <p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. To meet these requirements, when you open an
        account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also utilize a third-party information provider for verification purposes and/or ask for a copy of your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
        Please see the Customer Identification Program (CIP) Notice for further information.</p>
      <p>All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.  Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk it does not assure a profit, or protect against loss, in a down market. There is
        always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities, or other financial products.  Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.</p>
      <p>All securities and investments are offered to self-directed customers by Empala Securities, LLC, a member of FINRA & the SIPC.  Empala Securities, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Empala Group, LLC.   Additional information about Empala Securities, LLC and
